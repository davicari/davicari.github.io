                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p> I Have a smartrap, that started to be a little wonky, so i decided "let's scrap it and build something better without 3d printed parts"</p>
                <p> Disaster; i used steel 20mm square pipe, it was awfull to cut to length, and ever get parts to 90 degrees. I have not a workshop, neither a propper vise to do it.</p>
                <p> I used L shape plates, and nuts and bolts, i got something but as i was not following a plan, and more like going with the flow approach i found a dead end, where i had to carve wood parts to achieve some specific functionality</p>
                <p> Bottom Line: I should use 3d printed parts to build the structure, and have somewhat precision</p>
                <h3>Further steps:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>(re)Build the smartrap</li>
                    <li>Design the structure having in mind the parts i already have and the best way to use them</li>
                </ul>
