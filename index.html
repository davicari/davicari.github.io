                <h1> Projects i should be doing instead of anything else</h1>
                <p><strong>About this:</strong> This is meant to be some kind of documentation on projects i am never getting to an end.</p>
            
            <h3>A little bit of memory</h3>
            <p>
                With a group of friends including <a href="https://xlucianox.github.io/">Luciano</a> (the other one is named Elías, future edit will include a link to his blog if such a thing exist) started watching primitive technology and ended watching  <a href="http://homofaciens.de">homofaciens.de</a> on youtube.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the spark that started the colective fire to build a ROOT cnc. (Currently disembodied, see pending projects). In that process Luciano built his own desktop cnc with mostly scrap and recicled materials, and i was wondering if i should built a 3d printer. Elias is a veteran in the matter, he had a mdf laser cutted prusa like machine, that was enough to him to build a better version.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started getting old printers and scrapping resources, and then got the itch, and just ordered to ali express the hardware needed to build a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:651117">smartrap corexy</a> smartfriendz.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that printer, the printer of Elías and the printer Luciano got in his office, we built a <a href="https://rootcnc.com/">RootCNC V2</a>. We had to improvise in the z axis, because at that time, the hwin rails were privative to adquire, and we had to improvise.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted to use the cnc to desing and craft custom items. Luciano got it in his apartment, and used mostly to desing and machine some wood pieces with good results.
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time, i took the smartrap Luciano ensembled, made a few upgrades, from 12V to 24V, and a few cases for the electronics. Then, Luciano got a great job offering overseas, and he left me both cncs under my custody, the big one got to my parents house (because they have space), and the smal one was (screeching sound) DISSASEMBLED (/screeching sound), in order to acomodate it in the limited space i own.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Elías in my parents house we achive to built a table from a bed i scrapped, and used it to machine the last part of a wood bench, then we installed an mdf sacrificial bed, and noticed some issues with the z axis, mostly related to rigidity.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, here goes the downfall: I took the z axis in order to design a better alternative (that was may 2019, now january 2020). After a lot of working i got to somewhat good design of a carriage but noticed that the smartrap i was using, was having some precision issues, so i said to myself: "o i am so great engineer and such and so" and disassembled it in order to build a cubelike printer, with the option of using a dremmel in te tool carriage. That was a hell of a requirement, for another hell of lack of specific tools (cutting stuff to measure, in straight angles, is alienware).
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, i am realizing, after puting a lof of cash to the issue, that i am not going to get the printer ready within a reasonable amount of time, for a person who has a daytime job. So i decided that i have to use some kind of mental framework to do stuff:
            </p>
            <p class="jumbo">
                <h2>IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING: <strong>WRITE IT DOWN</strong></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>BROKE IT SIMPLE TASKS</li>
                    <li>BE <STRONG>REALISTIC</STRONG> WITH THE TIMEFRAMES</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course that is trivial, like eat healthy, sleep well, excercise, cultivate healty relationships and so on and so on. But, lacking discipline, perhaps writing it down, should work for me as a roadmap to follow.
